# UniMiSS-code
This is the official pytorch implementation of our ECCV 2022 paper "UniMiSS: Universal Medical Self-Supervised Learning via Breaking Dimensionality Barrier" and extended IEEE-TPAMI paper "UniMiSS+: Universal Medical Self-Supervised Learning From Cross-Dimensional Unpaired Data".


## News
* 5 Aug 2024: ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰Our extended version UniMiSS+ has been accepted by IEEE-TPAMI (Impact Factor=20.8). Code will be released soon.

## To do
- [ ] UniMiSS+ fine-tuning code
- [ ] UniMiSS+ pre-training code and weights
- [x] UniMiSS fine-tuning code
- [x] UniMiSS pre-training code and weights
