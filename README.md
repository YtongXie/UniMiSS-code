# UniMiSS-code
This is the official pytorch implementation of our ECCV 2022 paper "UniMiSS: Universal Medical Self-Supervised Learning via Breaking Dimensionality Barrier". In this paper, we advocate bringing a wealth of 2D images like chest X-rays as compensation for the lack of 3D data, aiming to build a universal medical self-supervised representation learning framework, called UniMiSS. We conduct expensive experiments on six 3D/2D medical image analysis tasks, including segmentation and classification. The results show that the proposed UniMiSS achieves promising performance on various downstream tasks, outperforming the ImageNet pre-training and other advanced SSL counterparts substantially.
