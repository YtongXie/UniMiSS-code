# UniMiSS & UniMiSS+
This is the official pytorch implementation of our ECCV 2022 paper "UniMiSS: Universal Medical Self-Supervised Learning via Breaking Dimensionality Barrier" and extended IEEE-TPAMI paper "UniMiSS+: Universal Medical Self-Supervised Learning From Cross-Dimensional Unpaired Data".

## To do
- [x] UniMiSS+ fine-tuning code
- [x] UniMiSS+ pre-training code and weights
- [x] UniMiSS fine-tuning code
- [x] UniMiSS pre-training code and weights
